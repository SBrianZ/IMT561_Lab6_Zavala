- **Short README describing audience + tasks:** The NYC 311 Mini Dashboard is a live visualization that highlights 
common listing complaints across NYC boroughs. Analysts, students, and other city stakeholders interested in 
studying rental management can use this dashboard to understand the most prevalent issues affecting different 
neighborhoods, across the five boroughs. Some questions that people can answer from this dashboard include the 
most common complaint type per borough, the most common channel people report their complaints, and the overall 
median time it takes for specific boroughs to respond to a specific listing complaint types._
